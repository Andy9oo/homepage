### [Techairos Consulting (Junior Software Engineer)](https://techairos.com/)

**Jan 2021 - Present**

At Techairos I work as a part of a small team, which manages multiple projects across a range of technologies. This includes full-stack development, mobile app development, and data automation pipelines.

Working in a small team, I've been involved in every part of the software lifecycle, including design, development, DevOps, deployment, and much more. This has given me the tools necessary to see a project from conception to final production release, with the ability to work in any part of the process.

Most of my work revolves around full-stack development, using [Angular](https://angular.io/) for frontend development, and API Gateway with AWS lambdas using the [serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/) for the backend. This is just the tip of the iceberg, however, as the wide range of projects I've worked on have demanded different skills and technologies, including mobile development using cross-platform frameworks such as [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org/), DevOps on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), and CI/CD systems using [TravisCI](https://www.travis-ci.com/).

On the non-technical side of things, I'm heavily involved in the design process in collaboration with my team and have been in charge of running multiple projects. These projects include managing student projects, both through our internship program and in collaboration with Stellenbosch University.

### [Techairos Consulting (Part-Time / Intern)](https://techairos.com/)

**Sep 2018 - Jul 2019**

I started working at Techairos part-time during my second year at Stellenbosch University. This continued into full time interships during the university holidays. In my time at Techairos, I worked mostly with the [Abalobi project](http://abalobi.info/), which is aimed at improving the livelihoods of small-scale fishers. A large portion of my time was spent migrating the companies servers onto AWS. This included selection of new DB technologies (migrating from Salesforce to MySQL), along with writing scripts for said data migration. Additionally, I migrated a portion of the companies back-end to AWS Lambda functions using Serverless.

During this process I was involved in decision making, with regards to the design of the new server architecture and database schemas.
For the course of the migration, I was placed into a management role over a small team. In this role, I was involved with planning and allocation of tasks to different team members. As a result, I have become familiar with the AWS ecosystem, including RDS, S3, EC2, and Lambda functions.

Other technologies worked with include: MySQL, NodeJS, Ionic Cordova, and AngularJS.

# Volunteer Work

### [WeCode24](https://wecode24.com/)

**Mar 2018 â€“ Aug 2018**

WeCode24 is an initiative, which aims to educate highschool learners in under-resourced schools about computer programming. I spent 6 months volunteering as a facilitator for WeCode24. In this time, I was involved with helping students to learn how to program in python by teaching them how to build basic animations and games.
