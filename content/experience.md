### [Techairos Consulting (Part-Time / Intern)](https://techairos.com/) 
**Sep 2018 - Jul 2019**

I started working at Techairos part-time during my second year at Stellenbosch University. This continued into full time interships in the university holidays. During my time at Techairos, I worked mostly with the [Abalobi project](http://abalobi.info/), which is aimed at improving the livelihoods of small-scale fishers. A large portion of my time was used migrating the companies servers onto AWS. This included selection of new DB technologies (migrating from Salesforce to MySQL), along with writing scripts for said data migration. Additionally, I migrated a portion of the companies back-end to AWS Lambda functions.

During this process I was involved in decision making, with regards to the design of the new server architecture and database schemas.
For the course of the migration, I was placed into a management role over a small team. In this role, I was involved with planning and allocation of tasks to different team members. As a result, I have become familiar with the AWS ecosystem, including RDS, S3, EC2, and Lambda functions.

Other technologies worked with include: MySQL, NodeJS, Ionic Cordova, and AngularJS.

# Volunteer Work
### [WeCode24](https://wecode24.com/)
**Mar 2018 â€“ Aug 2018**

WeCode24 is an initiative, which aims to educate grade 8 to 11 learners in under-resourced schools about computer programming. I spent 6 months volunteering as a facilitator for WeCode24. In this time, I was involved with helping students to learn how to program using python by teaching them how to build basic animations and games.
