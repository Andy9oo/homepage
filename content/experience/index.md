**_Jan 2021 - Dec 2021_**

At Techairos I worked as a part of a small team, which managed multiple projects across a range of technologies. This includes full-stack development, mobile app development, and data automation pipelines.

I was involved in every part of the software lifecycle, including design, development, DevOps, deployment, and much more. This has given me the tools necessary to see a project from conception to final release, with the ability to work in any part of the process.

Most of my work revolved around full-stack development, however, the wide range of projects I've worked on have demanded different skills and technologies such as:
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) for frontend development
- The [serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/) using API Gateway with AWS lambdas for backend development
- Cross-platform frameworks such as [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org/) and [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) for mobile development
- A variety of [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) technologies
- CI/CD systems using [TravisCI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)

On the non-technical side of things, I was heavily involved in the design process in collaboration with my team and have been in charge of running multiple projects. These projects include managing student projects, both through our internship program and in collaboration with Stellenbosch University.

**_Sep 2018 - Jul 2019_**

I started working at Techairos part-time during my second year at Stellenbosch University. This continued into full-time internships during the university holidays. In my time as an intern, I worked mostly with the [Abalobi project](http://abalobi.info/), which involved the development of their mobile and web apps. In addition to this, I was involved in the migration of the companies servers onto AWS. During this migration, I was placed into a management role over a small team and was given the responsibility of coordinating the design of the new server architecture.

**_Mar 2018 â€“ Aug 2018_**

WeCode24 is an initiative, which aims to educate high school learners in under-resourced schools about computer programming. I spent six months volunteering as a facilitator for WeCode24. In this time, I was involved with helping students to learn how to program in python by teaching them how to build basic animations and games.
