At Techairos I worked as a part of a small team, which managed multiple projects across a range of technologies. This includes full-stack development, mobile app development, and data automation pipelines.

I was involved in every part of the software lifecycle, including design, development, DevOps, deployment, and much more. This has given me the tools necessary to see a project from conception to final release, with the ability to work in any part of the process.

Most of my work revolved around full-stack development, however, the wide range of projects I've worked on have demanded different skills and technologies such as:
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) for frontend development
- The [serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/) using API Gateway with AWS lambdas for backend development
- Cross-platform frameworks such as [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org/) and [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) for mobile development
- A variety of [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) technologies
- CI/CD systems using [TravisCI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)

On the non-technical side of things, I was heavily involved in the design process in collaboration with my team and have been in charge of running multiple projects. These projects include managing student projects, both through our internship program and in collaboration with Stellenbosch University.
