I started working at Techairos part-time during my second year at Stellenbosch University. This continued into full-time internships during the university holidays. In my time as an intern, I worked mostly with the [Abalobi project](http://abalobi.info/), which involved the development of their mobile and web apps. In addition to this, I was involved in the migration of the companies servers onto AWS. During this migration, I was placed into a management role over a small team and was given the responsibility of coordinating the design of the new server architecture.
