Flash is a full-text desktop search engine, designed to help users find their files. Using preprocessing techniques, flash creates an index, allowing searching without having to crawl the filesystem, substantially reducing search times. Flash is written purely in Go to allow for the use of concurrency during preprocessing and search.
