# Inefsin

This project was developed for the Inefsin fishing syndicate, to allow members to book cottages online. Members can log in to the website to view available dates on the calendar, and submit booking requests. Admins can then review these booking requests and either accept or reject them, emailing users the result. The project runs serverless, using Google's Firebase as a back-end, and AngularJS for the front-end.
