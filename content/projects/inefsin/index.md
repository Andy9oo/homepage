This project was developed for the Inefsin fishing syndicate, to allow members to book cottages online. Members can log in to the website to view available dates on the calendar, and submit booking requests.

Admins can review these booking requests in a separate panel and either accept or reject them, emailing users the result.

 The project runs as a serverless project, using Google's Firebase and cloud functions as a backend, and Angular for the front-end. In addition to this, SendGrid was used to handle all transational emails, to both admins and users.
